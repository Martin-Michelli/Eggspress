# Eggspress
UMN EE1301 IoT project, cooks eggs through the internet using Particle Photon microcontroller.
Usign C++, a wooden frame, servo motors, a relay, the microcontroller, an electric stovetop, and the help of my friends, we were able to build a device that cracks eggs that are loaded into a chamber, and cook them. The device could be operated both manually, and through the cloud.
